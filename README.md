* With all these retirements, the first step is to look at employees eligible for a mentorship program:
    1. There are 1,549 employees eligible for a mentorship program.
    2. These potential mentors should be sufficient to train incoming employees.
* This leaves a large amount of positions unfilled. 

## Conclusion
#### Time to start a mentorship program and get new employees on board

It is time for Pewlet Hackard to start hiring fresh people so they don't end up with a labor shortage with all the retirements in the near future. Lucky for them they have many retirement eligible employees who are also eligible for a mentorship program so they can help train incoming employees.
